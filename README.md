# ThePotato

<h3>TODO List:</h3>

make a program that can take fake data that matches the current protocol, 
and produce sudo drive commands for the iRobot platform (ex move: speed x, angle x, time x)

possibly implement network communications (ie pi1 sends its location to pi2 pi2 then runs above code)
